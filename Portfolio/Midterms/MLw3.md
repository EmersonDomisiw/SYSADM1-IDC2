# SYSADM1 -- Platform Services

# Requirement: 

-   A virtual machine running Windows Server

    **Objective/s:**

    To analyze IIS logs in the Event Viewer to identify critical web
    service metrics, understand common error codes, and learn how to
    monitor the health of web applications.

**Instructions**

**Part 1: Opening Event Viewer and Loading Logs**

1.  Access the event viewer in the server.

2.  From the event viewer, explore the windows log and list down its
    major categories

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

| **Setup**                                                             |
|                                                                       |
| **System**                                                            |
|                                                                       |
| **Forwarded Events**                                                  |

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

**Part 2: Filtering and Analyzing IIS Events**

1.  Apply filter to the windows log categories to display errors for the
    past 12 hours.

2.  **Identify Critical Events** or recurring events.

3.  **Analyze the Events**:

    -   For each critical or recurring event, **record the following
        details**:

        -   **Event ID**

        -   **Source**

        -   **Timestamp**

        -   **Description**

**Part 3: Troubleshooting and Solution Development**

1.  Review the logs and check for recurring errors.

2.  Is there a specific time or pattern to these errors?

3.  Draft a Troubleshooting Report:

    -   Based on the events found, create a short report with the
        following sections:

**Report Structure**

**1.** Overview

-   A brief summary of the issue and scope of your analysis.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Based on the issue that I encountered in the troubleshooting, it
  indicates failures in the application installations and configurations
  that's why it causes some issues while I am doing the troubleshooting
  process.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**2.** Key Findings

-   List the critical events you found. Example:

    -   **Event ID 503**: Application pool stopped at 10:05 AM.

    -   **Event ID 404**: Page not found error at 11:15 AM.

**3.** Root Causes and Solutions

-   Describe the likely cause of each error and how you would fix it.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| -   Event ID 8198: My windows installer service failed to start which |
|     had hinder the application installations.                         |
|                                                                       |
| Solution: Restart the Windows Installer                               |
|                                                                       |
| -   Event ID 4199: Missing installation files.                        |
|                                                                       |
| Solution: Verify the integrity of the installation files and          |
| re-download if necessary                                              |
+=======================================================================+
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

**Part 4: Reflection Questions**

1.  What are the most common causes of a **503 Service Unavailable**
    error?

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| The most common causes of 503 Service Unavailable are:                |
|                                                                       |
| -Maintenance or downtime of the server                                |
|                                                                       |
| -Resource limitations(CPU memory)                                     |
|                                                                       |
| -High traffic in the server                                           |
+=======================================================================+
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

2.  How would you **monitor login attempts** to detect potential
    security threats?

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| -Setting up an alerts for multiple failed logins                      |
|                                                                       |
| -Enabling auditing for login events in Windows server                 |
|                                                                       |
| -Review the security logins to monitor in the Event Viewer to see the |
| failed attempts that is created                                       |
+=======================================================================+
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

3.  Why is **monitoring logs** in Event Viewer important for
    administrators?

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| -For the reason that it identifies errors and application issues.     |
|                                                                       |
| -It tracks security events and potential breaches that is happening.  |
|                                                                       |
| -It helps the network engineers to be updated about errors,           |
| unauthorized activities and system failures so that it will be safe   |
| and secured when using any applications and avoid threats and         |
| vulnerabilities from happening.                                       |
